# BioGrid

**GUI tool for pairwise sequence alignment grid generation in bioinformatics**  

Made with [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) and [Go](https://go.dev/)

## Supported algorithms
- Needleman-Wunsch (Global alignment)
- Smith-Waterman (Local alignment)

## TODO
- [ ] Add support for ends free alignment
- [ ] Add grid backtrace visualization
- [ ] Add generation of aligned sequences
- [ ] Add support for substitution matrix
